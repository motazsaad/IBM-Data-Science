steps for pre-trained CNN 

1. load data (pre-loaded data in TF, or load from directory) 
data already split into train & val (test) 

choose image size: less than 200 * 200 
choose batch size = 32
img, label = load_data(.......
train_ds = load_data_from_direcory(.......

2. build CNN without pre-trained model, and report accuracy 

3. choose pre-trained model 

4. load pre-trained model without top (last layer), and freeze model (trainable = false)

5. add classification head (2 or 3 layers) 

6. compile model (optimizer, loss, metrics, ...) 

7. fit model report accuracy, compare with step 2
