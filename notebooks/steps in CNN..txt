steps in CNN 

1. load data (pre-loaded data in TF, or load from directory) 
data already split into train & val (test) 

choose image size: less than 200 * 200 
choose batch size = 32
img, label = load_data(.......
train_ds = load_data_from_direcory(.......
2. build sequential model and add layers 
	input 
	conv layers followed by pool layers
	add dense layers 
	last layer: # of units (neurons) = # classes 
3. compile model (choose optimizer, choose loss (according to classes: binary or categorical), choose metrics according to task (classification or regression) 
4. train (fit) model, check overfit 

prevent overfit ==> use dropout layer
